I have a function called processUserData written in JS. Review the code ACTING as three experts:

1. Experienced developer – Focus on code quality, structure, readability. Point out weaknesses and give clear improvement suggestions.
2. Security engineer – Identify potential security risks. Look for data leaks, validation, insecure handling, or bad practices.
3. Performance specialist – Analyze efficiency. Highlight any bottlenecks or slow logic. Suggest ways to optimize and speed up the function.

For each role SEPARATLY, provide a short analysis with actionable recommendations.

Here is the code:
function processUserData(data: any) {
var users = \[];

for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
var user = {
id: data\[i].id,
name: data\[i].name,
email: data\[i].email,
active: data\[i].status === 'active' ? true : false
};
users.push(user);
}
console.log("Processed " + users.length + " users");
return users;
}

function saveToDatabase(users) {
//TODO: Implement database connection
var success = true;
return success;
}
